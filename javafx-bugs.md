# JavaFX Bugs
A list of JavaFX bugs I have found while making these JavaFX examples.

- When a MenuButton is moved from a monitor with one pixel density to another monitor with a different pixel density
  (e.g. a labtop monitor to a bigger, externally attached monitor), the menu items showing when the MenuButton is
  activated no longer align with the button. There is a vertical gap in between the MenuButton and the menu items.
